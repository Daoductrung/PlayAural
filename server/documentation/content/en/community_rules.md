Community Rules



PlayAural aims to create a fun, equal, and accessible gaming space for everyone. To maintain this environment, I ask that you follow these guidelines.



1\. Multilingual Environment



PlayAural welcomes players from all over the world.



\* No Language Restrictions: We do not ban or restrict any specific language in the global chat. You are free to speak your native language.

\* Communication: As this is a diverse community, we encourage players to use translation tools to understand each other when necessary.

\* Personal Preference: If you find the global chat distracting or prefer not to see other languages, you have the option to disable Global Chat in your Options.



2\. Conduct \& Behavior



\* Respect Others: Please be kind to your fellow players. Harassment, insults, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.

\* No Spam: Avoid spamming messages, advertisements, or excessive commands that disrupt the experience for others.



3\. Administrative Discretion



To ensure a safe environment for the community:



\* I (the administrator) reserve the right to suspend or permanently ban any account found to be in serious violation of these rules, without prior notice.



4\. Updates \& Feedback



\* Work in Progress: As PlayAural is currently in active development, these rules are subject to change and may be updated at any time to better serve the community.

\* Feedback Welcome: Your suggestions regarding the game rules or community guidelines are highly appreciated. Please feel free to share your thoughts.



Thank you for being part of PlayAural!
