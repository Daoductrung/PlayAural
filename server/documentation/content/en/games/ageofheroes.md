\*\*Age of Heroes\*\*



Age of Heroes is a civilization-building card game for 2 to 6 players. Each player leads an ancient tribe -- Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, Babylonians, Celts, or Chinese -- competing for dominance through resource management, construction, trading, and dice-based combat.



There are three paths to victory: build an empire of five cities, complete your tribe's monument of culture by collecting five special resources, or simply be the last tribe standing after eliminating all your rivals.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



A game of Age of Heroes is structured into repeating "days", consisting of three phases: Preparation, Fair, and Play. Before the first day begins, there is a one-time Setup phase to determine turn order.



\*\*Setup\*\*



When the game starts, every player is randomly assigned one of the six tribes. Each tribe has a unique special resource tied to their monument (for example, Egyptians need Limestone, Romans need Concrete, Greeks need Marble, and so on). All players roll two dice (2d6) to determine turn order. The highest roller goes first. Each player is then dealt an initial hand of 5 cards.



\*\*Preparation Phase\*\*



At the start of each day, mandatory event cards in players' hands are resolved automatically:

\* \*\*Population Growth:\*\* You receive a free city immediately.

\* \*\*Earthquake:\*\* From Day 2 onward, disables an opponent's armies for one turn.

\* \*\*Eruption:\*\* From Day 2 onward, destroys one of an opponent's cities.

\* \*\*Hunger:\*\* From Day 2 onward, ALL players lose one Grain card.

\* \*\*Barbarians:\*\* From Day 2 onward, the holder loses 2 conventional resource cards.



\*\*Fair Phase (Trading)\*\*



Players draw cards based on their road network (at least 1 card, plus more for each connected tribe). Then the trading auction opens. Players can offer cards and specify what they want in return. When offers match, the trade executes automatically. You cannot trade your own tribe's special resource.



\*\*Play Phase\*\*



On your turn, you draw a card and then choose one action:



1\. \*\*Tax Collection:\*\* Draw cards equal to your number of cities. If you have no cities, exchange one card for a new draw.

2\. \*\*Construction:\*\* Spend resources (Gold acts as a wildcard) to build:

&nbsp;  \* \*\*Army:\*\* 1 Iron + 2 Grain

&nbsp;  \* \*\*City:\*\* 2 Wood + 1 Stone

&nbsp;  \* \*\*Fortress:\*\* 1 Iron + 1 Wood + 1 Stone

&nbsp;  \* \*\*General:\*\* 1 Iron + 1 Gold

&nbsp;  \* \*\*Road:\*\* 2 Stone (requires neighbor's permission)

3\. \*\*War:\*\* Declare war on a target with one of three goals:

&nbsp;  \* \*\*Conquest (Day 3+):\*\* Capture cities.

&nbsp;  \* \*\*Plunder:\*\* Steal cards from the defender's hand.

&nbsp;  \* \*\*Destruction:\*\* Damage the defender's monument progress.

&nbsp;  Combat is resolved in rounds of 1d6 rolls. Generals grant +2, and fortresses add to the defender's roll.



\*\*Scoring \& Victory\*\*



The game ends immediately when a player achieves one of the following:

\* \*\*Empire of Five Cities:\*\* Accumulate 5 cities.

\* \*\*Carriers of Great Culture:\*\* Collect all 5 of your tribe's special resources.

\* \*\*The Most Persistent:\*\* Be the last player remaining (others are eliminated at 0 cities and 0 cards).



\*\*Keyboard Shortcuts\*\*
