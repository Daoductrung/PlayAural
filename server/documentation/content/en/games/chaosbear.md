Chaos Bear



Chaos Bear is a thrilling chase game where you run from a relentless bear. The goal is simple: stay ahead and survive!

Gameplay



The game is played in rounds. In each round, every player takes a turn first, followed by the bear.



Player's Turn



On your turn, you generally Roll Dice to move forward (1-6 spaces).

Rage: If the bear rolls a 3, its Energy increases by 1 permanently.



Getting Caught
