\*\*Chaos Bear\*\*



Chaos Bear is a push-your-luck chase game for 2 to 4 players. You and your fellow players are being pursued by an increasingly energetic bear, and your goal is simple: don't get caught.



Each round, players roll a die to sprint forward along a number line. The bear then takes its own turn, rolling to close the gap. As the game goes on, the bear accumulates energy, making it faster and harder to outrun. If the bear reaches your position, you're out. The last player still running wins -- or, if everyone gets caught in the same bear turn, the player who made it the furthest takes the victory.



Drawing cards on special squares adds a layer of chaos to the proceedings, with effects ranging from a helpful boost forward to an unfortunate shove backward -- or even meddling with the bear's energy level.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



The game takes place on an infinite track. All players begin at position 30, while the bear starts at position 0. The game is divided into rounds; each round, every surviving player takes one turn, and then the bear moves.



\*\*Player Turns\*\*



On your turn, you roll a single six-sided die (values 1 through 6) and move forward that many squares. Your turn then ends.



However, if you are standing on a position that is a positive multiple of 5 (such as 30, 35, 40, and so on), you have the option to draw a card instead of rolling. Drawing a card ends your turn as well. The card's effect is applied immediately. See the Cards section below for the full list of possible outcomes.



\*\*The Bear's Turn\*\*



After all surviving players have moved, the bear moves. The bear rolls a die (1 through 3) and adds its current energy to the roll. 

\* \*\*Exception:\*\* If the bear rolls a 3, its energy increases by 1, but that extra point of energy does not count toward movement on this turn.



The bear's energy starts at 1 and never drops below 1. If the bear's new position is equal to or greater than any player's position, those players are eliminated. After catching players, the bear loses 3 energy (minimum 1) as it stops to eat.



\*\*Winning\*\*



The game ends when only one player remains alive. If the bear catches everyone in a single turn, the player who reached the furthest position wins.



\*\*Cards\*\*



Available only on multiples of 5:

\* \*\*Impulsion:\*\* Leap forward 3 squares.

\* \*\*Super Impulsion:\*\* Leap forward 5 squares.

\* \*\*Tiredness:\*\* The bear loses 1 energy (minimum 1).

\* \*\*Hunger:\*\* The bear gains 1 energy.

\* \*\*Backward Push:\*\* Shoved back 3 squares (minimum 0).

\* \*\*Random Gift:\*\* Move forward or backward by 1-6 squares (coin flip).



\*\*Example Turn\*\*



It's the start of a game. Charlie and Diana are at position 30, and the bear is at 0.

Charlie rolls a 5 and moves to position 35. 

Diana is at 30 (a multiple of 5) and decides to draw a card. She draws \*\*Super Impulsion\*\* and leaps to 35.

The bear rolls a 1 + energy of 1, moving to position 2.



A few rounds later, Charlie is at 45 and Diana is at 42. The bear is at 38 with an energy of 4.

Charlie draws a card and gets \*\*Backward Push\*\*, moving back to 42.

Diana rolls a 1 and moves to 43.

The bear rolls a 3. Its energy increases to 5, but it moves 3 + 4 = 7 to position 45. The bear has passed both Charlie and Diana. Since Charlie reached position 45 and Diana only reached 43, Charlie is the winner!
