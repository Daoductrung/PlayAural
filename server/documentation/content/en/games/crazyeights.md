Crazy Eights



Crazy Eights is a shedding-type card game where the first player to empty their hand receives points based on the cards remaining in other players' hands.



Objective



Be the first to reach the winning score (default: 500). You score points by emptying your hand of cards before your opponents.



Game Setup



\* Players: 2 to 8.

\* Deck: Two standard decks of cards.

\* Starting Hand: 7 cards per player.



Gameplay



1\. A starting card is flipped from the deck to start the discard pile.

2\. Players take turns playing a card from their hand.

3\. To play a card, it must match the Rank or Suit of the top card on the discard pile.

4\. Eights (8) are Wild: An 8 can be played on any card. When you play an 8, you must choose the suit for the next player to follow.



Drawing and Passing



\* If you cannot play a card (or choose not to), you must Draw a card from the deck.

\* You draw only one card.

\* If the drawn card is playable, you may play it immediately.

\* If the drawn card is not playable, you must Pass your turn.



Special Action Cards



Some cards have special effects when played:



\* Jack (J): Reverse. Reverses the direction of play. (In a 2-player game, acts as a Skip).

\* Queen (Q): Skip. Skips the next player's turn.

\* King (K): Draw Two. The next player must draw 2 cards and loses their turn.



Scoring

\* Eights (8): 50 points.

\* Face Cards (J, Q, K): 20 points.

\* Aces: 1 point.

\* Number Cards (2-10): Face value (e.g., a 7 is worth 7 points).
