\*\*Crazy Eights\*\*



Crazy Eights is a classic shedding card game where the goal is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. It has been a family favorite for generations, and if you have ever played UNO, you already know the basic idea -- Crazy Eights is, in fact, the game that inspired UNO.



Players take turns matching the top card of the discard pile by suit or rank, using eights as wild cards to change the suit at will. The first player to empty their hand wins the round and scores points based on the cards left in their opponents' hands.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



The game supports 2 to 8 players and uses two standard 52-card decks shuffled together. Each round, every player is dealt 5 cards, and a starting card is turned face-up from the deck to begin the discard pile. This starting card will always be a numbered card (never a wild or face card).



On your turn, you must play a card from your hand that matches either the suit or the rank of the top card on the discard pile. For example, if the top card is a 7 of Hearts, you can play any Heart or any 7 from another suit.



\*\*Special Cards\*\*



\* \*\*Wild 8:\*\* Eights can be played on top of anything, at any time. When you play a Wild 8, you choose the suit that the next player must follow.

\* \*\*Skip:\*\* Skips the next player's turn entirely.

\* \*\*Reverse:\*\* Reverses the direction of play. In a two-player game, it simply skips the other player.

\* \*\*Draw Two:\*\* Forces the next player to draw 2 cards and lose their turn.



\*\*Drawing and Passing\*\*



If you have no playable cards, you must draw one card from the deck. If the drawn card is playable, you can play it immediately. If not, you pass and your turn ends. You cannot draw if you already have a playable card in your hand.



\*\*Scoring\*\*



When a player empties their hand, they score points based on the cards remaining in all opponents' hands:

\* \*\*8's (Wild):\*\* 50 points each

\* \*\*Skips, Reverses, and Draw Twos:\*\* 20 points each

\* \*\*Aces:\*\* 1 point each

\* \*\*Number cards (2-7, 9-10):\*\* Face value (e.g., a 5 is worth 5 points)



The game continues until a player reaches the winning score (configurable up to 10,000).
