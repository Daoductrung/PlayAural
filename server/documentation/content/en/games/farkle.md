Farkle



Farkle is a classic push-your-luck dice game where players roll dice to score combinations. You must decide whether to stop and bank your points or risk it all for more!



Objective



Be the first player to reach the winning score (Default: 500 points).



Gameplay



On your turn, you start by rolling 6 dice.



1\. Check for Points: After rolling, check if you have any scoring combinations (see below).

2\. Farkle!: If you rolled NO scoring combinations, your turn ends immediately, and you lose any points accumulated during this turn.

3\. Take Points: Select at least one scoring combination to "take" (move aside). These points are added to your temporary turn score.

4\. Risk or Stop:

  \* Roll Again: You can roll the remaining dice to try and score more.

  \* Bank: You can stop and bank your current turn score into your permanent total. This ends your turn.

5\. Hot Dice: If you manage to score with all 6 dice, you get "Hot Dice"! You receive 6 fresh dice and must continue rolling, accumulating even more points.
