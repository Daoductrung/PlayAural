\*\*Farkle\*\*



Farkle is a push-your-luck game which dates back to at least the 18th century. It is probably one of the most well-known dice games in the blind community, and you may have played it before on any number of platforms.



The goal is to make combinations of dice without getting Farkles (rolls entirely devoid of valid combinations). Each combination is worth a number of points. Victory is achieved when someone's score passes a certain threshold; 500, 1,000, 3,000 and 5,000 are common choices.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



The game is divided into distinct rounds, in which everyone takes a turn. On your turn, you will start with six dice. At this point, your only choice is to roll.



Then, take any combinations you see fit, adding their value to your turn score; to be clear, you aren't obliged to take every combination you roll. That is one strategic part of the game. The dice you haven't used in combinations can be rolled again.



If you manage to use all six of your dice, you'll get a fresh new set - this is known as having obtained \*\*"Hot Dice"\*\*, and can be done many times in one turn if you're lucky.



However, if you do not roll any valid combinations, you are considered to have \*\*Farkled\*\*; your turn ends and all your accumulated points for that turn are forfeit. If you have enough points and think the risk outweighs the reward, you \*\*Bank\*\* your turn score, adding it to your total and ending your turn.



\*\*Example Turn\*\*



It's the start of the game and you're up first.

1\. You roll 1-2-3-4-5-6. You take the \*\*Large Straight\*\* (200 points), achieving \*\*Hot Dice\*\*.

2\. You roll again: 1-2-2-2-6-6. You choose to take only the \*\*Single 1\*\* (10 points), ignoring the three twos to keep more dice for the next roll.

3\. Your turn score is now 210. You roll the remaining 5 dice: they land on 1-1-4-4-5. 

4\. You take the two ones (10 pts each) and the five (5 pts) and \*\*Bank\*\*, for a total score of 235.
