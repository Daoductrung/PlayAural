Left Right Center



Left Right Center (LRC) is a fast-paced dice game of chance where chips are passed around the table. The goal is to be the last player holding any chips!



Objective



Be the last player remaining with chips.



Game Setup



\* Players: 2 to 20.

\* Chips: Each player starts with a set amount of chips (Default: 3).



Gameplay



On your turn, you roll specialized dice. The number of dice you roll is determined by how many chips you currently have (up to a maximum of 3 dice).



For each die rolled, the face determines where your chip goes:



\* L (Left): You pass one chip to the player on your left.

\* R (Right): You pass one chip to the player on your right.

\* C (Center): You put one chip into the Center Pot. These chips are removed from play forever!

\* Dot (•): You keep your chip.



Losing \& Winning



\* Staying Alive: If you lose all your chips, you are not out of the game! You skip your turn (since you can't roll), but you can still receive chips from the players on your left or right. If you receive chips, you are back in the game and can roll again on your next turn.

\* The Winner: The winner is determined when only one player has chips remaining. That player wins the game (and collects the pot).



Keyboard Shortcuts



\* R: Roll dice.

\* C: Check current Center Pot size.
