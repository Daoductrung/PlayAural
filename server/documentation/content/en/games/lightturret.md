\*\*Light Turret\*\*



Light Turret is a resource management game for 2 to 4 players, blending risk and reward in a strategic push-your-luck format. The concept is simple: you manage a turret, shooting it to accumulate light and coins. But be careful — if your light exceeds your turret's power capacity, you are eliminated.



The goal is to finish the game with the most light. You can spend coins on upgrades to raise your power limit, giving yourself more room to keep shooting. However, upgrades carry a 25% chance of backfiring and adding light to your turret instead. The game runs for a set number of rounds, and whoever has the most light at the end wins.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



The game is divided into rounds, in which every surviving player takes a turn. On your turn, you have two main choices: shoot the turret or buy an upgrade.



\*\*Shooting\*\*

Shooting the turret is the core action. When you shoot, you gain a random amount of light (between 1 and 4) and earn coins equal to twice the light gained. For example, if you gain 3 light, you also pocket 6 coins. If your total light exceeds your power, you are eliminated on the spot. Your light total still counts toward the final standings, but you can no longer take turns.



\*\*Upgrading\*\*

If you have at least 10 coins, you can spend them on a power upgrade. 

\* \*\*Success:\*\* Increases your power by a random amount between 2 and 8.

\* \*\*Backfire (25% chance):\*\* Instead of gaining power, a random amount of light (between 1 and 5) is added to your turret. This can result in elimination.



\*\*Game End\*\*



The game ends when one of two conditions is met:

1\. The maximum number of rounds is reached (default: 50).

2\. All players have been eliminated.



The player with the most accumulated light wins. Eliminated players are still ranked by their light total, so getting eliminated early doesn't always mean you will finish last.



\*\*Example Turn\*\*



You start with the default power of 10. You currently have 6 light and 8 coins. 

1\. You decide to shoot. You gain 3 light (total 9) and 6 coins (total 14). You are now at 9/10 capacity.

2\. Next round, you spend 10 coins on an upgrade. It succeeds, granting 5 extra power. Your power is now 15, and your light remains at 9. You now have 6 points of "headroom" to continue shooting safely.
