Light Turret



Light Turret is a strategic resource management game where you manage a turret's energy levels. The goal is to accumulate as much Light as possible without overloading your system!



Objective



Collect the most Light by the end of the game.



Resources



\* Light: Your score. Gained by shooting.

\* Power: Your capacity limit. If your Light exceeds your Power, you overload and are eliminated.

\* Coins: Currency used to buy upgrades. You earn coins by shooting.



Gameplay



On your turn, you must choose one of two actions:



1\. Shoot (Space)

Fire your turret to generate resources.

\* You gain 1-4 Light.

\* You gain Coins equal to double the Light gained.

\* Warning: If this shot increases your Light above your current Power, you explode!



2\. Upgrade (U)

Spend 10 Coins to try and increase your capacity.

\* Success (75% chance): Your Power increases by 2-8. This allows you to store more Light safely.

\* Accident (25% chance): The upgrade backfires! Instead of Power, you gain 1-5 Light. This is dangerous as it might cause an overload!



Elimination



You are eliminated if your Light > Power at any moment. Eliminated players are out of the game.



Winning



The game ends when the maximum number of rounds is reached or when all players are eliminated. The player with the highest Light score wins.
