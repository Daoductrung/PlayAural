\*\*Midnight (1-4-24)\*\*



Midnight (also known as 1-4-24) is a classic dice game that has been a pub and party staple for generations. It is a game of risk management and dice selection: you roll six dice, but you can only score if your final hand includes both a 1 and a 4. 



The remaining four dice are summed for your score, with a perfect 24 (four sixes) being the best possible result — hence the name 1-4-24. The game is played over a series of rounds, and the player who wins the most rounds wins the overall game.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



A game consists of a set number of rounds (default is 5). Each round, every player takes a turn rolling dice. At the end of the round, the player with the highest score wins that round.



\*\*Your Turn\*\*



On your turn, you start with six standard dice. 

1\. \*\*Roll:\*\* Your first move is always to roll all six.

2\. \*\*Keep:\*\* After each roll, you must keep at least one die. Kept dice become locked for the rest of your turn and cannot be changed.

3\. \*\*Reroll:\*\* You reroll whatever dice remain until all six dice are locked.



\*\*Qualifying\*\*



To score, your final set of six dice must contain both a \*\*1\*\* and a \*\*4\*\*. If you are missing either one, you are disqualified for that round and score zero. Securing a 1 and a 4 is your priority, but remember that these two dice do not count toward your point total.



\*\*Scoring \& Winning\*\*



\* \*\*Scoring:\*\* If you qualify (having at least one 1 and one 4), the remaining four dice are summed.

\* \*\*Winning a Round:\*\* The qualified player with the highest score wins the round. If nobody qualifies, no one wins the round.

\* \*\*Winning the Game:\*\* The player with the most round wins at the end of the game is the overall winner.



\*\*Example Turn\*\*



1\. You roll all six dice: \*\*3-1-5-4-2-6\*\*. 

2\. You have a 1 and a 4, so you keep them to qualify immediately. You also keep the 6 (the highest score possible). 

3\. You now have three dice locked (1, 4, 6) and three to reroll.

4\. You roll the remaining three: \*\*2-5-3\*\*. You keep the 5 and reroll the last two.

5\. They come up \*\*6-6\*\*. You keep both. 

6\. \*\*Final Score:\*\* You have a 1 and a 4 (qualified), and your other dice are 6, 5, 6, 6. Total score: 23.
