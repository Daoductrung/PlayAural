Midnight



Midnight, also known as 1-4-24, is a dice game where you must qualify by rolling a 1 and a 4 to score points.



Objective



Win the most rounds by having the highest score in each round.



Gameplay



In each round, every player takes a turn rolling 6 dice.



1\. Roll: You roll all available dice.

2\. Keep: You must "keep" (lock) at least one die after every roll. You can keep more if you wish. Once a die is kept, it cannot be re-rolled.

3\. Repeat: You continue rolling the remaining dice until all 6 dice are kept.

4\. Bank: Once all dice are kept, you bank your score to finish your turn.



Scoring



To get ANY score, your final set of 6 dice must contain at least one 1 and one 4.



\* Qualifying: If you have a 1 and a 4, they are set aside. Your score is the sum of the other 4 dice. (Maximum possible score is 24: four 6s).

\* Disqualified: If you lock all dice but do not have both a 1 and a 4, you score 0 for the round.



The player with the highest score wins the round. The player who wins the most rounds at the end of the game wins the match.
