\*\*Mile by Mile\*\*



Mile by Mile is a racing card game based on the classic French game Mille Bornes, created in 1954 by Edmond Dujardin. The name translates to "a thousand milestones," referring to the kilometer markers along French roads.



The goal is to race your car to the finish line by playing distance cards, while throwing hazards at your opponents and using remedies and safeties to keep yourself moving. The first player or team to reach the winning score across multiple races takes the victory.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



Each race, every player starts stopped. You must play a \*\*Green Light\*\* to get moving. On your turn, you draw a card to bring your hand to 7 and then either play or discard one card.



\*\*Distance Cards\*\*

These add miles to your total: 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200 miles. 

\* \*\*Movement:\*\* You can only play these when you are moving (no active hazards or stops).

\* \*\*Speed Limit:\*\* If you have this hazard, you can only play 50 miles or less.

\* \*\*The 200-Mile Rule:\*\* You are only allowed to use a 200-mile card \*\*twice per race\*\*.

\* \*\*Perfect Crossing:\*\* By default, you must reach the target distance (e.g., 1,000 miles) exactly.



\*\*Hazards and Remedies\*\*

\* \*\*Stop / Green Light:\*\* Stops the car.

\* \*\*Speed Limit / End of Limit:\*\* Restricts distance cards to 50 miles.

\* \*\*Out of Gas / Gasoline:\*\* Stops the car.

\* \*\*Flat Tire / Spare Tire:\*\* Stops the car.

\* \*\*Accident / Repairs:\*\* Stops the car.



\*\*Safety Cards\*\*

These provide permanent protection for the rest of the race and grant an extra turn:

\* \*\*Extra Tank:\*\* Protects against Out of Gas.

\* \*\*Puncture Proof:\*\* Protects against Flat Tire.

\* \*\*Driving Ace:\*\* Protects against Accident.

\* \*\*Right of Way:\*\* Protects against Stop and Speed Limit. You never need a Green Light again.



\*\*Dirty Tricks (Coup Fourré)\*\*

When an opponent plays a hazard on you, you have a \*\*7-second window\*\* to play the matching safety card from your hand by pressing \*\*D\*\*. This blocks the hazard and earns 300 bonus points at the end of the race.



\*\*Scoring\*\*

\* \*\*Distance:\*\* 1 point per mile.

\* \*\*Trip Complete:\*\* 400 points.

\* \*\*Safe Trip:\*\* 300 points (completing the race without using any 200-mile cards).

\* \*\*Shut Out:\*\* 500 points (opponents have 0 miles).

\* \*\*Dirty Tricks:\*\* 300 points each.
