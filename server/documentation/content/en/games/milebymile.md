Mile by Mile



Mile by Mile is a classic racing card game based on Mille Bornes. The goal is to be the first team to reach the target distance (usually 1000 miles) while impeding your opponents with hazards.



Objective



Race to reach exactly 1000 miles (default) before your opponents. The first team to reach a total score of 5000 points across multiple rounds wins the match.



Gameplay



On your turn, you draw a card and must then play or discard one card.



Card Types



1\. Distance Cards (25, 50, 75, 100, 200 miles)

\* Played to advance your car.

\* You must have a Green Light to start moving.

\* You cannot play distance cards if you are stopped by a Hazard.

\* 200 Mile limit: You can only play a maximum of two 200-mile cards per round.



2\. Hazards

Attacks you play on opponents to slow them down.

\* Stop: Stops an opponent. They need a "Green Light" to move again.

\* Speed Limit: Limits an opponent to 50 miles per turn.

\* Out of Gas: Stops an opponent. They need "Gasoline".

\* Flat Tire: Stops an opponent. They need a "Spare Tire".

\* Accident: Stops an opponent. They need "Repairs".



3\. Remedies

Used to fix Hazards played on you.

\* Green Light: Allows you to move. Cures "Stop" and is needed to restart moving after fixing other hazards (Gas, Tire, Accident).

\* End of Limit: Cures Speed Limit.

\* Gasoline: Cures Out of Gas.

\* Spare Tire: Cures Flat Tire.

\* Repairs: Cures Accident.



4\. Safeties

Powerful cards that provide permanent immunity.

\* Right of Way: Prevents/Cures "Stop" and "Speed Limit". You never need a Green Light to move!

\* Extra Tank: Prevents "Out of Gas".

\* Puncture Proof: Prevents "Flat Tire".

\* Driving Ace: Prevents "Accident".



Coup Fourré (Dirty Trick)



If an opponent plays a Hazard on you, and you have the corresponding Safety card in your hand, you can play it immediately (even if it's not your turn) to declare a Coup Fourré.

\* You score 300 bonus points.

\* The hazard is immediately removed.

\* You get an extra turn immediately.



Winning the Round



The round ends when a team reaches the target distance (1000 miles).

\* Exact count required: You must reach the target distance exactly. If a card would take you over, you cannot play it.



Options \& Variants



\* Allow Stacking Attacks: If enabled, you can stack multiple hazards on an opponent (e.g., giving them a Flat Tire while they are already Out of Gas).

\* Karma Rule (False Virtue): If enabled, special "False Virtue" cards are added to the deck. You cannot play a Hazard on an opponent who holds a "False Virtue" card. If you try, the attack fails!

\* Team Mode: Can be played Individually or in Teams (e.g., 2v2).

\* Shift + Enter: Discard the selected card.
