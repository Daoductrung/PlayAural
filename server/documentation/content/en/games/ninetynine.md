\*\*Ninety Nine\*\*



Ninety Nine is a classic card game of survival and strategy. Players take turns playing cards that add to (or sometimes subtract from) a shared running total, and the goal is simple: don't be the one to push it over 99.



The game has been a staple in the blind gaming community for years, appearing in both the Quentin C Playroom and RS Games platforms. PlayAural supports both variants. At its core, Ninety Nine is an elimination game: every player starts with a set of tokens, loses them for making mistakes, and is knocked out when they run dry. The last player standing wins.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



Ninety Nine is played in rounds at a \*\*table\*\*. At the start of each round, the running count resets to 0, and every surviving player is dealt a fresh hand of cards (3 by default).



On your turn, you play one card from your hand to modify the running count. Most cards add their face value, but special cards have unique effects. After playing, you draw a replacement card (automatically or manually, depending on the \*\*host's\*\* settings).



The round ends when someone pushes the count over 99 (a "bust"), or until someone has no cards left. The offending player loses tokens, and a new round begins.



\*\*Card Values\*\*



\*\*Quentin C Variant (Default)\*\*

\* \*\*Ace:\*\* Choose +1 or +11. Automatically plays as +1 if the count is above 88.

\* \*\*3-8:\*\* Adds face value.

\* \*\*9:\*\* Pass card (adds 0).

\* \*\*10:\*\* Choose +10 or -10. Automatically plays as -10 if the count is 90 or above.
