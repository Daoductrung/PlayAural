Ninety Nine



Ninety Nine is a fast-paced card game where players take turns adding values to a running total. The objective is simple: never be the one to make the total exceed 99!



Objective



Be the last player remaining with tokens. You lose a token if you cannot play a card without pushing the count over 99.



Gameplay



1\. Total Count: The game maintains a central "Count" which starts at 0.

2\. Turn Structure: On your turn, you play one card from your hand, which modifies the Count.

3\. Drawing: After playing, you automatically draw a replacement card (unless the deck runs out).

4\. Busting: If you cannot play any card without the Count going over 99, you "Bust". You lose a token and a new round begins.

5\. Elimination: If you lose all your tokens, you are out of the game.
