\*\*Pig\*\*



Pig is basically the quintessential dice game. In many ways, it leads into more complex choices found in games like Farkle and Toss Up.



The idea is dead simple: roll a die, add it to your running total, and decide whether to keep going or bank what you have. But if you roll a 1, you lose everything you have accumulated that turn. The first player (or team) to reach the target score wins.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



The game is divided into rounds, and in each round every player takes one turn. On your turn, you have two choices: \*\*Roll\*\* or \*\*Bank\*\*.



\* \*\*Rolling:\*\* A single die is thrown. If the result is anything other than a 1, the number is added to your turn score and you can choose to roll again or bank. You can keep rolling as many times as you like to build a massive score.

\* \*\*Busting:\*\* If you roll a 1, you "bust." Your entire turn score is wiped out, you get 0 points for the turn, and it passes to the next player.

\* \*\*Banking:\*\* If you choose to bank, your accumulated turn score is added to your permanent total, ending your turn safely.



The game continues until a player or team reaches the target score at the end of a round. If multiple teams hit the target in the same round, a tiebreaker is played.



\*\*Customizable Options\*\*



The \*\*host\*\* can tweak several settings at the \*\*table\*\*:

\* \*\*Target Score:\*\* Default is 50 (range 10 to 1,000).

\* \*\*Minimum Bank Points:\*\* The minimum score you must reach in a single turn before being allowed to bank (default 0, up to 50).

\* \*\*Dice Sides:\*\* Default is 6 sides, but can be set from 4 to 20. More sides lower the risk of busting.



\*\*Example Turn\*\*



The target score is 50 and you have 38 points. You need 12 more to win.

1\. You roll a 4. Turn score: 4. 

2\. You roll again and get a 5. Turn score: 9. 

3\. You roll again and get a 2. Turn score: 11. You are 1 point away from the target!

4\. You decide to risk it and roll one last time...

5\. Oh no, a 1! You bust, lose all 11 points, and your total stays at 38.
