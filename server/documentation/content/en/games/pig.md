Pig



Pig is a classic push-your-luck dice game. The goal is to be the first to reach the target score by rolling a die and banking points, while avoiding rolling a 1.



Objective



Be the first player (or team) to reach the Target Score (default: 50).



Gameplay



On your turn, you roll a single die repeatedly.



Roll: You roll the die.

\* If you roll a 1: You Bust. You lose all points accumulated in this turn, and your turn ends immediately.

\* If you roll any other number: That number is added to your temporary "Turn Score".



Decision: After a successful roll (not a 1), you can choose to:

\* Roll Again: Risk your current Turn Score to add more points.

\* Bank: Add your Turn Score to your permanent Total Score and end your turn.



Options \& Variants



\* Target Score: The score required to win (Default: 50).

\* Dice Sides: Change the number of sides on the die (Default: 6). Increasing this reduces the chance of rolling a 1 (Busting).

\* Min Bank Points: Minimum points required in a turn before you are allowed to Bank.

\* Team Mode: Play Individually or in Teams.



Keyboard Shortcuts



\* R: Roll dice.

\* B: Bank points.
