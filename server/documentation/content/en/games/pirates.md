\*\*Pirates of the Lost Seas\*\*



Pirates of the Lost Seas is an RPG-style adventure game for 2 to 5 players. You sail across a 40-tile map spanning four randomly selected oceans, collecting gems and battling other pirates with cannonballs. As you play, you earn experience points (XP) and level up, unlocking increasingly powerful skills.



The goal is to have the highest score when all 18 gems have been collected. Your score comes entirely from the gems you hold at the end of the game, so attacking other players and stealing their gems is a key strategy.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



The game is divided into rounds, and in each round every player takes one turn. On your turn, you choose an action: sail to an adjacent tile, fire a cannonball at a nearby opponent, or use an unlocked skill.



\*\*The Map \& Movement\*\*

The map consists of 40 tiles divided into 4 oceans. You start at a random position. As you level up, you can sail further in a single turn:

\* \*\*Level 0+:\*\* Move 1 tile left or right.

\* \*\*Level 15+:\*\* Move up to 2 tiles.

\* \*\*Level 150+:\*\* Move up to 3 tiles.



\*\*Gems\*\*

There are 18 gems scattered across the map:

\* \*\*Common Gems (1 point):\*\* Opal, Ruby, Diamond, etc.

\* \*\*Rare Gems (2 points):\*\* Gem of the Palace, Awesome Blue Bastardstone, etc.

\* \*\*Legendary Gem (3 points):\*\* Definitely Not Cursed Black Pearl (tm).

Landing on a tile with a gem collects it automatically. The game ends when the last gem is found.



\*\*Combat\*\*

You can fire a cannonball at any player within 5 tiles. 

\* \*\*Attack/Defense:\*\* Both sides roll a d6 and add their respective skill bonuses. If the attacker rolls higher, it's a hit.

\* \*\*On a Hit:\*\* You earn XP and choose to \*\*Push\*\* the defender (3-8 tiles) or \*\*Steal\*\* a gem (if enabled).

\* \*\*On a Miss:\*\* The defender earns XP for fending you off.



\*\*XP and The Golden Moon\*\*

\* \*\*XP Sources:\*\* Finding gems, hitting an opponent, or successfully defending.

\* \*\*The Golden Moon:\*\* Every 3rd round, the Golden Moon rises, tripling all XP gains.

\* \*\*Leveling:\*\* Each level requires (Level x 20) XP.



\*\*Skills\*\*

\* \*\*Level 10:\*\* Sailor's Instinct (View map sectors).

\* \*\*Level 25:\*\* Portal (Teleport to another player's ocean).

\* \*\*Level 40:\*\* Gem Seeker (Reveal a gem's location - 3 uses).
