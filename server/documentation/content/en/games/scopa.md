\*\*Scopa\*\*



Scopa is a classic Italian card game whose origins stretch back to at least the 18th century. The name means "broom" in Italian, referring to the act of sweeping all the cards off the table. It is one of the most popular card games in Italy and has many regional variants played across the Mediterranean.



The goal is to capture cards from the table by playing cards from your hand that match table cards by rank, or whose value equals the sum of multiple table cards. The first player (or team) to reach the target score wins.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



Scopa is played with a standard deck with the picture cards removed (40 cards total). The game is divided into rounds. On your turn, you must play exactly one card from your hand.



\*\*Capturing Cards\*\*

1\. \*\*Rank Match:\*\* If the card you play matches the rank of a card on the table, you capture that card.

2\. \*\*Sum Match:\*\* If no single card matches by rank, but multiple table cards add up to the rank of your played card, you capture that entire set.

3\. \*\*Priority:\*\* A rank match always takes priority over a sum combination.

4\. \*\*Scopa:\*\* If you clear the entire table with a single capture, you score a \*\*"Scopa"\*\* (1 bonus point).



If your card cannot capture anything, it is simply placed on the table. When all players run out of cards, a new deal occurs from the remaining deck. Any cards left on the table after the final play of the round go to the player who made the last capture.



\*\*Scoring\*\*



At the end of each round, 1 point is awarded for each of the following (no points are given in the event of a tie):

\* \*\*Most Cards:\*\* Captured the most total cards.

\* \*\*Most Diamonds:\*\* Captured the most cards of the Diamonds suit.

\* \*\*7 of Diamonds:\*\* Captured the specific 7 of Diamonds card.

\* \*\*Most Sevens:\*\* Captured the most 7s.

\* \*\*Scopas:\*\* 1 point for every time you cleared the table during play.



\*\*Game Variants\*\*

\* \*\*Escoba Mode:\*\* Captures are made when the played card and table cards sum to exactly 15.

\* \*\*Inverse Scopa:\*\* Reaching the target score eliminates you; the last player standing wins.
