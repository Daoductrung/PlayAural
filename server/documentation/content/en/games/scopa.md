Scopa



Scopa is a classic Italian card game played with a 40-card deck. The goal is to capture cards from the table by matching their values or sums, and ultimately scoring points based on collected cards.



Objective



Score points to reach the Target Score (default: 11). Points are awarded at the end of each round for:



\* Scopas: Clearing all cards from the table (1 point each).

\* Most Cards: Capturing the most cards total (1 point).

\* Most Diamonds: Capturing the most Diamond suits (Coins/Denari) (1 point).

\* Settebello: Capturing the 7 of Diamonds (1 point).

\* Most Sevens: Capturing the most cards of rank 7 (1 point).



Gameplay



Cards are dealt to players (usually 3 at a time) and 4 cards are placed on the table. On your turn, you play one card from your hand:



\* Capture by Rank: If there is a card on the table with the same value as your card, you capture it.

\* Capture by Sum: If there is no direct match, you can capture a set of cards that sum up to your card's value.

&nbsp;   \* Example: You play a King (10) to capture a 3 and a 7.

\* Discard: If you cannot capture anything, your card stays on the table.



If you capture all cards on the table, you score a Scopa (Sweep)!



Options \& Variants



\* Escoba Mode: If enabled, the rules change to the Spanish variant Escoba. You only capture cards that sum with your played card to exactly 15.

\* Target Score: Score needed to win (Default: 11).

\* Cards Per Deal: Number of cards dealt at once (Default: 3).

\* Inverse Scopa: If enabled, the goal is to avoid scoring. Reaching the target score eliminates you!

\* Instant Win Scopas: If enabled, getting a Scopa can instantly win the match if your team score is high enough.
