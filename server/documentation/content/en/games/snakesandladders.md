\*\*Snakes and Ladders\*\*



Snakes and Ladders is a classic racing board game that originated in ancient India as "Moksha Patam." It is a game of pure luck, where players navigate their pieces from the start (Square 1) to the finish (Square 100), helped by ladders representing virtues and hindered by snakes representing vices.



The goal is simple: be the first player to reach exactly Square 100.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



The game is played in rounds, and on your turn, you roll a single six-sided die.



\*\*Movement\*\*

\* You move your piece forward the number of squares shown on the die.

\* \*\*Ladders:\*\* If you land exactly at the bottom of a ladder, you automatically climb to the top, skipping many squares.

\* \*\*Snakes:\*\* If you land exactly on the head of a snake, you slide down to its tail, losing your progress.



\*\*Winning the Game\*\*

To win, you must land exactly on Square 100. If your die roll is higher than the number of squares needed to reach 100, your piece "bounces back" from the finish line. 

\* \*\*Example:\*\* If you are at Square 98 and roll a 5, you move forward 2 spaces to 100, then move backward the remaining 3 spaces, landing on Square 97.
