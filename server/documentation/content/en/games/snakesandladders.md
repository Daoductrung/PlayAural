Snakes and Ladders



Snakes and Ladders is a classic racing board game. Players navigate their piece from the start (Square 1) to the finish (Square 100), helped by ladders and hindered by snakes.



Objective



Be the first player to reach exactly Square 100.



Gameplay



On your turn, you roll a single die (1-6).

Your piece moves forward that many spaces.



\* Ladders: If you land at the bottom of a ladder, you climb up to the top.

\* Snakes: If you land on the head of a snake, you slide down to its tail.

\* Winning: You must roll the exact number to land on Square 100. If you roll higher than needed, you "bounce back" the excess amount.

    \* Example: You are at 98 and roll a 5. You move forward 2 to 100, then bounce back 3 to 97.
