Threes

Threes is a low-score dice game where the number 3 is your best friend.

Objective

The goal is to get the lowest score possible after the set number of rounds (Default: 10).

Gameplay

You play with 5 dice.

1. Roll: You roll all available dice.
2. Keep: You must choose to keep at least one die from the current roll.
    * Key 1 through 5 toggles which dice to keep.
    * Kept dice become locked and cannot be rolled again.
3. Repeat: Roll the remaining dice and repeat the process until all 5 dice are locked.
    * Note: If you only have 1 die left, it is automatically kept and scored.

Scoring

* Rank 3: Worth 0 Points. (This is good!)
* Other Ranks: Worth their face value (1 = 1 point, 6 = 6 points).
* Shooting the Moon: If you manage to get Five 6s, your score is -30 (Negative 30), which is amazing!

Example:
* You end with: 3, 3, 1, 4, 3.
* Score: 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 5 Points.
