Tradeoff

Tradeoff is a collaborative yet competitive dice game where players build a collection of 15 dice over three trading rounds. The goal is to form specific scoring combinations from your final hand of 15 dice.

Objective

Reach the Target Score (Default: 60) before your opponents.

Gameplay

A full round consists of 3 Iterations. In each iteration:

1.  **Roll**: Every player rolls 5 dice.
2.  **Trade**:
    *   Players select which of their 5 dice they want to **Trade** (put into the shared pool) and which they want to **Keep**.
    *   Once all players confirm their trades, the traded dice are revealed and added to the pool.
    *   Kept dice move to your permanent hand.
3.  **Take**:
    *   Players take turns picking dice from the pool to add to their hand.
    *   You must take back exactly the same number of dice you traded.
    *   **Turn Order**: The player with the lowest score goes first! (In the first round, order is determined by lobby position).

After 3 iterations, everyone will have 15 dice in their hand.

Scoring

After the 3rd iteration, your 15 dice are automatically analyzed to find the best possible scoring combination. Non-overlapping sets are formed to maximize your score.

**Scoring Combinations:**

*   **Triple** (3 Points): 3 dice of the same value.
*   **Mini Straight** (7 Points): 4 consecutive values (e.g., 1-2-3-4).
*   **Group** (8 Points): 5 dice of the same value.
*   **Double Triple** (10 Points): Two sets of Triples (e.g., 3x Twos and 3x Fives).
*   **Straight** (12 Points): 5 consecutive values (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5).
*   **Double Group** (30 Points): Two sets of Groups (e.g., 5x Twos and 5x Fives).
*   **All Groups** (50 Points): Three sets of Groups (15 dice total).
*   **All Triplets** (50 Points): Five sets of Triples (15 dice total).
