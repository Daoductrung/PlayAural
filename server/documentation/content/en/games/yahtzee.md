\*\*Yahtzee\*\*



Yahtzee is a classic dice game that has been a household staple since 1956. It is a game of strategy, probability, and luck. The goal is to roll five dice to fill in 13 scoring categories on your scoresheet. Each category can only be used once, so deciding when to score or "scratch" a category is the heart of the game.



The player with the highest total score at the end of 13 rounds wins.



\*\*Gameplay\*\*



The game supports 1 to 4 players. On your turn, you can roll the dice up to three times.

1\. \*\*First Roll:\*\* Roll all five dice.

2\. \*\*Rerolls:\*\* After the first and second rolls, you can choose to keep any number of dice and reroll the rest.

3\. \*\*Scoring:\*\* After your third roll (or sooner if you are satisfied), you must choose one of your 13 categories to record a score. If your dice don't fit the category, you receive a 0.



\*\*Scoring Categories\*\*



\*\*Upper Section\*\*

You score the sum of the dice matching the category (Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes).

\* \*\*Bonus:\*\* If the total of your Upper Section is \*\*63 or higher\*\*, you receive a \*\*35-point bonus\*\*.



\*\*Lower Section\*\*

\* \*\*Three of a Kind / Four of a Kind:\*\* Sum of all five dice.

\* \*\*Full House:\*\* 25 points (3 of one value, 2 of another).

\* \*\*Small Straight:\*\* 30 points (4 consecutive numbers).

\* \*\*Large Straight:\*\* 40 points (5 consecutive numbers).

\* \*\*Yahtzee:\*\* 50 points (All 5 dice the same).
