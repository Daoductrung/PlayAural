Yahtzee

Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with five dice. The player's objective is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations.

Objective

The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, you roll the dice and then score the roll in one of 13 categories. You must score once in each category. The objective is to get the highest total score.

Gameplay

On your turn, you have up to 3 rolls:

1.  **First Roll**: Roll all 5 dice.

After your rolls (or whenever you choose to stop), you must assign your dice to one of the 13 scoring categories.
