Welcome to PlayAural



Welcome to PlayAural, an online gaming platform designed with an audio-first approach and a strong focus on accessibility.



The goal of this online platform is simple: to provide a shared space where casual players can easily enjoy games together on equal footing. I aim to support better multi-language experiences and create a straightforward environment for anyone who just wants to play and have fun.



About the Project



I am Trung (ddt.one), the developer and administrator of this version.



PlayAural is built upon the excellent open-source foundation of PlayPalace. I express my sincere gratitude to the original creators for their incredible work, which made this project possible.



Please note that PlayAural is currently in active development. Updates and improvements are happening regularly. Your feedback, bug reports, and suggestions are always welcome and highly appreciated.



Getting Started



1\. Play: Select "Play" from the Main Menu to browse the game catalog. From there, you can create a new table or view existing ones for a specific game.

2\. View active tables: Located below the "Play" button, this option lets you see all tables currently active on the server across all games.

3\. Invite: Feel free to invite friends or add computer-controlled Bots to fill empty seats at your table.



Chat Commands



You can use special commands in the chat box by typing a forward slash / followed by a keyword:



\* /g message (or /global): Type slash g to send a message to the global chat channel, visible to everyone on the server.



Note: Commands for table management and checking online administrators are currently under maintenance and are not listed here.
